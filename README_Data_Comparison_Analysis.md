## Critical Issues in Previous Implementations

### 1. Unrealistic Knock Rate Problem

**Previous Implementations:**
```python
# data_creation.py - FIXED 0.5% evenly spaced
knock = np.zeros(N, dtype=bool)
step = round(1 / 0.005)  # Every 200 points
knock[::step] = True

# engine_knock_month.py - TARGET 30% but achieved 14.7%
TARGET_KNOCK_RATE = 0.30  # 30% - COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC
desired_knock_rows = int(TARGET_KNOCK_RATE * N)
```

**Problems Identified:**
- **30% knock rate**: Would indicate catastrophic engine failure
- **14.7% actual rate**: Still 30-50x higher than real engines
- **Fixed spacing**: Unrealistic periodic knock occurrence
- **No physics basis**: Arbitrary threshold selection

**New Implementation:**
```python
BASE_KNOCK_PROBABILITY = 0.002  # 0.2% realistic baseline
# Results in 0.396% actual knock rate - realistic for modern engines
```

### 2. Flawed Knock Detection Logic

**Previous Implementation Problems:**
```python
# engine_knock_month.py - Arbitrary thresholds
high_rpm = rpm > 3200           # No engineering justification
lean_mix = ego_volt < 0.44      # Widened arbitrarily
hot_cyl = temp_sens > 95        # Fixed threshold

# Fallback when insufficient rows
if len(eligible_idx) < desired_knock_rows:
    eligible_mask = high_rpm & lean_mix  # Drops temperature requirement
```

**Issues:**
- **Arbitrary thresholds**: No basis in combustion physics
- **Binary conditions**: Real knock probability is continuous
- **Fallback logic**: Compromises data integrity to meet target rate
- **No load consideration**: Ignores primary knock factor (engine load)

**New Implementation:**
```python
def calculate_knock_probability(self, rpm, load, cylinder_pressure, ignition_timing):
    knock_prob = np.full(len(rpm), BASE_KNOCK_PROBABILITY)
    
    # High load increases knock probability (primary factor)
    high_load_mask = load > HIGH_LOAD_THRESHOLD
    knock_prob[high_load_mask] *= 3.0
    
    # Multiple interacting factors
    high_rpm_mask = rpm > HIGH_RPM_THRESHOLD
    knock_prob[high_load_mask & high_rpm_mask] *= 2.0
    
    # Advanced timing and high pressure effects
    advanced_timing_mask = ignition_timing > 25
    knock_prob[advanced_timing_mask] *= 1.5
```

## Knock Rate Analysis

### Real-World Knock Occurrence Data

| Engine Type | Normal Operation | Stress Testing | Severe Conditions |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Modern ECU-Controlled | 0.1-0.3% | 0.5-1.0% | 2-5% |
| Racing Engines | 0.3-0.8% | 1-3% | 5-10% |
| Research Engines | 0.2-0.5% | 1-2% | 3-8% |

### Comparison of Generated Knock Rates

| Implementation | Target Rate | Actual Rate | Realism Score |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| `data_creation.py` | 0.5% (fixed) | 0.5% | Poor (fixed spacing) |
| `engine_knock_month.py` | 30% | 14.7% | Terrible (catastrophic level) |
| **New Generator** | **Physics-based** | **0.396%** | **Excellent (realistic)** |

### Statistical Analysis

**Previous Data Issues:**
- **Non-random distribution**: Fixed intervals or arbitrary selection
- **Unrealistic clustering**: High concentrations in certain conditions
- **Poor class balance**: Either too frequent or artificially spaced

**New Generator Advantages:**
- **Probabilistic distribution**: Natural variation in knock occurrence
- **Condition-dependent**: Higher probability under realistic knock conditions
- **Proper class balance**: Suitable for machine learning without artificial balancing

## Physics-Based Improvements

### 1. Combustion Modeling

**Previous Approach:**
```python
# Simplistic Wiebe function application
P_normal = P_max * burn_rate(theta, 10, 40, 5, 3)
cylinder_pressure = 13.3 + P_normal + 3 * np.random.randn(N)
```

**Problems:**
- **Fixed parameters**: No RPM or load dependency
- **Constant baseline**: Unrealistic pressure baseline
- **Simple addition**: No interaction between combustion and knock

**New Approach:**
```python
def calculate_cylinder_pressure(self, rpm, load, ignition_timing):
    compression_pressure = 12 + 2 * rng.standard_normal(len(rpm))
    combustion_pressure = load * 0.3 * (1 + 0.1 * np.sin(ignition_timing * np.pi / 180))
    rpm_effect = 0.002 * (rpm - 1000)
    return compression_pressure + combustion_pressure + rpm_effect
```

**Improvements:**
- **Load dependency**: Pressure scales with engine load
- **Timing effects**: Ignition timing affects peak pressure
- **RPM dynamics**: Speed affects pressure characteristics
- **Realistic ranges**: 8-58 bar vs. previous unrealistic values

### 2. Ignition Timing Calculation

**Previous Approach:**
```python
# Fixed timing regardless of conditions
ignition_timing = np.full(N, 10.0)  # Constant 10° BTDC
```

**New Approach:**
```python
def calculate_ignition_timing(self, rpm, load):
    base_timing = 10 + 15 * (rpm - RPM_IDLE) / (RPM_MAX - RPM_IDLE)
    load_compensation = -0.1 * (load - 50)  # Retard under high load
    return np.clip(base_timing + load_compensation + noise, 5, 35)
```

**Improvements:**
- **RPM advancement**: Timing advances with RPM for efficiency
- **Load retardation**: Timing retards under high load to prevent knock
- **Realistic range**: 5-35° BTDC vs. fixed 10°
- **Noise modeling**: Realistic variation in timing control

### 3. Thermal Dynamics

**Previous Approach:**
```python
# Instant temperature changes
temp_sens[knock_indices] += 8  # Immediate +8°C during knock
```

**New Approach:**
```python
def calculate_temperature_sensor(self, load, rpm, knock_events):
    # Thermal inertia modeling
    tau = 30  # 30-second time constant
    alpha = 1 / (tau * SAMPLE_RATE_HZ + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, len(temp_signal)):
        temperature[i] = alpha * temp_signal[i] + (1 - alpha) * temperature[i-1]
```

**Improvements:**
- **Thermal inertia**: Realistic temperature response time
- **First-order dynamics**: Proper thermal lag modeling
- **Load correlation**: Temperature rises with engine load
- **RPM effects**: Cooling vs. friction heat balance

## Sensor Modeling Comparison

### 1. Vibration Sensor

**Previous Implementation:**
```python
# Simple sinusoidal with fixed frequency
vib_base = 0.1 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * (rpm / 60) * t_sec)
vib_knock[knock_indices] = 0.5  # Fixed amplitude spike
```

**New Implementation:**
```python
def calculate_vibration_sensor(self, rpm, knock_events):
    firing_freq = rpm / 60 * (CYLINDERS / 2)  # Proper firing frequency
    primary_vib = 0.05 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * firing_freq * t / SAMPLE_RATE_HZ)
    harmonic_vib = 0.02 * np.sin(4 * np.pi * firing_freq * t / SAMPLE_RATE_HZ)
    mechanical_noise = VIBRATION_BASELINE * rng.standard_normal(len(rpm))
```

**Improvements:**
- **Correct firing frequency**: 4-stroke engine firing pattern
- **Harmonic content**: Realistic frequency spectrum
- **Variable amplitude**: Knock amplitude varies naturally
- **Mechanical noise**: Realistic background vibration

### 2. EGO (Oxygen) Sensor

**Previous Implementation:**
```python
ego_voltage = 0.45 + 0.05 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 0.1 * t_sec)
ego_voltage[knock_indices] -= 0.15  # Fixed reduction during knock
```

**Problems:**
- **Fixed oscillation**: Unrealistic constant frequency
- **Wrong knock response**: EGO should increase during knock (lean condition)
- **No load dependency**: Real EGO varies with air-fuel ratio

**New Implementation:**
```python
def calculate_ego_voltage(self, load, knock_events):
    base_voltage = 0.45  # Stoichiometric voltage
    mixture_effect = -0.05 * (load - 50) / 50  # Load affects mixture
    oscillation = 0.03 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * np.arange(len(load)) / 10)
    ego_voltage[knock_events] += 0.1  # Lean spike during knock (correct direction)
```

**Improvements:**
- **Load correlation**: Higher load = richer mixture
- **Correct knock response**: Lean condition during incomplete combustion
- **Realistic oscillation**: Closed-loop control system behavior
- **Proper voltage range**: 0.1-0.9V vs. unrealistic values
