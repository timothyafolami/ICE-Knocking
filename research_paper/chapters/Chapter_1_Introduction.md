# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Background and Motivation

Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) knock detection represents one of the most critical challenges in modern automotive engineering, directly impacting engine performance, fuel efficiency, and component longevity. Engine knock, also known as detonation, occurs when the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber ignites prematurely or unevenly, creating pressure waves that can cause severe engine damage if not detected and mitigated promptly.

The automotive industry has witnessed a paradigm shift toward intelligent predictive maintenance systems, driven by advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Traditional knock detection methods, primarily based on threshold-based approaches using knock sensors, often suffer from false positives and limited adaptability to varying engine operating conditions. Recent research by Liu et al. (2024) and Han & Kim (2024) has demonstrated that machine learning approaches, particularly ensemble neural networks, can significantly improve fault detection accuracy in automotive applications.

## 1.2 Problem Statement

Current engine knock detection systems face several critical limitations:

1. **High False Positive Rates**: Traditional threshold-based systems generate excessive false alarms, leading to unnecessary engine performance limitations and reduced fuel efficiency.

2. **Imbalanced Data Classification**: Engine knock events represent less than 2% of normal engine operation, creating a severe class imbalance problem that challenges conventional machine learning algorithms.

3. **Real-time Detection Requirements**: Automotive applications demand sub-millisecond response times for knock detection to prevent engine damage, requiring computationally efficient algorithms.

4. **Limited Predictive Capabilities**: Existing systems are reactive rather than predictive, detecting knock events after they occur rather than predicting and preventing them.

5. **Integration Challenges**: Modern engines require integrated systems that can simultaneously forecast engine parameters and predict potential knock events for comprehensive predictive maintenance.

## 1.3 Research Objectives
